    <h5>RRR</h5>
    <p></p> This is my all time favourite movie. while watching this movie every nerve in my body started dancing,Eventually they became tight with an anxiety and excitement.This is the Tribute to the indian cinema by one of the greatest director's Rajamouli sir.</p>
    <h5>DASARA</h5>
    <P></P> I am a big fan of one and only Natural star Nani.The maximum credit of the movie goes to nani,the climax was terrific it is such that people call it DASARA and fans call it DASARAAW!!.This is one of the nani's career best performance(which is the Routine dialogue after his evey film)</P>
